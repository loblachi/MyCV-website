                     <h4><i>Hi, my name is Trevlin Naicker...</i></h4>
                     <h3><i>But, who am I ?</i></h3>
                     <p>I am a passionate and motivated individual with a strong interest in both hardware and software, particularly when it comes to building, maintaining, and improving computer systems. I recently graduated from Durban University of Technology with a Diploma in ICT in Applications Development, and while my studies focused heavily on software and coding, I’ve also developed a deep interest in the physical side of technology. </p>
                     <p>Over time, I’ve worked hands-on with laptops—replacing RAM, upgrading storage devices, and applying thermal paste to maintain system performance. These experiences have helped me gain a better understanding of how computers function on a hardware level and have strengthened my desire to work in roles where I can troubleshoot, upgrade, and install both hardware and software systems. I take pride in being a hard worker, someone who is committed to constantly learning and improving. I’m eager to build a career where I can combine my academic background with my practical experience, and I’m always ready to take on new challenges to grow in the tech industry.</p>
