                     <h4><i>Hi, my name is Trevlin Naicker...</i></h4>
                     <h3><i>But, who am I ?</i></h3>
                     <p>I am a passionate and motivated individual with a deep interest in both hardware and software technology. I recently graduated from Durban University of Technology with a Diploma in ICT in Applications Development. While my formal education focused mainly on software development, my curiosity and drive to understand technology as a whole led me to explore and work with hardware as well. Ive always enjoyed taking things apart, understanding how they work, and improving them and that mindset has played a big part in shaping the kind of technician and problem-solver I aspire to be.</p>
                     <h3><i>What can I do?</i></h3>
                     <p>Over time, I’ve gained hands-on experience working with laptops and desktops, doing things like replacing RAM, upgrading storage devices (HDDs and SSDs), and reapplying thermal paste to help resolve overheating issues. These tasks require patience, attention to detail, and a willingness to learn - skills I’ve developed through both personal projects and helping friends and family troubleshoot their devices. In addition to my hardware abilities, I also have a solid foundation in software and application development through my diploma. This gives me a unique combination of skills that allows me to approach IT challenges from both a hardware and software perspective.</p>
                     <h3><i>Why should you hire me?</i></h3>
                     <p>I’m a hard-working, fast-learning individual who takes pride in doing things the right way. I don’t just do tasks , I try to understand them, improve on them, and grow from every opportunity. I’m not afraid to get my hands dirty, ask questions, or take initiative when something needs to be done. What drives me is the excitement of solving real-world problems and constantly learning new things in the process. I’m looking for an opportunity where I can apply my skills, grow under the guidance of experienced professionals, and contribute positively to a team. If given the chance, I will bring not only technical ability but also a strong work ethic and a mindset geared toward continuous improvement.</p>
